also if u dont already know how to color a string, here u go:

so put this before the text IN a string "<color=white>" then this after "</color>"
so it should look like this
string = "<color=white> hello </color>"
u can change the color by removing the "white" part and changing it to any of these:

red
cyan
magenta
yellow
blue
green
grey
black
white

(not important stuff)
