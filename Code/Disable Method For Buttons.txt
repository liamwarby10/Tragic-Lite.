put this after the on method

disableMethod =() => Mods.MODNAME(),

replace "MODNAME" with the name of your method

so the button should look like this

new ButtonInfo { buttonText = "MOD", method =() => Mods.ENABLEMOD(), disableMethod =() => Mods.DISABLEMOD(), enabled = false, toolTip = "TOOLTIP!"},



(not important stuff)
