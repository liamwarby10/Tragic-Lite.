if the gui is not showing up unless you have your vr connected,
you need these 2 files to make it work without your vr.

so take these 2 files and put them in your, BepInEx,config folder
so go to your gorilla tag game folder, then go to BepInEx folder
then go to "config" and delete the "BepInEx" file that is already in there
then drop in the 2 files and open your game

you know you have done it right when a black screen pops up
when you launch the game

Hope this helps :3
